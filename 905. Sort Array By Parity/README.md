# Problem: Sort Array by Parity

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`.  
Rearrange the array so that **all even integers appear first**, followed by **all odd integers**.

You may return **any valid array** that satisfies this condition.

## Example 1

### Input

nums = [3,1,2,4]


### Output

[2,4,3,1]


### Explanation
Valid outputs include:

[4,2,3,1]
[2,4,1,3]
[4,2,1,3]

Any arrangement with all evens first and odds later is acceptable.

## Example 2

### Input

nums = [0]


### Output

[0]


---

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5000
- 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 5000
