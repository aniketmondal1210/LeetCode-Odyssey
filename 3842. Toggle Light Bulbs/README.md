# Light Bulb Switching

## Problem Statement

There are 100 light bulbs numbered from `1` to `100`.  
Initially, all bulbs are **off**.

Given an array `bulbs[]`, for each element:

- If that bulb is **off** → switch it **on**
- If that bulb is **on** → switch it **off**

Return a list of bulb numbers that remain **on** at the end, sorted in ascending order.  
If none are on, return an empty list.
