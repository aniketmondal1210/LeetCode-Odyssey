## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `num`, return **true** if `num` can be expressed as the sum of any non-negative integer and its reverse, otherwise return **false**.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

num = 443

**Output**

true

**Explanation**
443 can be written as `172 + 271 = 443`.

### Example 2
**Input**

num = 63

**Output**

false

**Explanation**
63 cannot be expressed as the sum of any number and its reverse.

---

### Example 3
**Input**

num = 181

**Output**

true

**Explanation**
181 can be written as `140 + 041 = 181`.  
Leading zeros are allowed when reversing numbers.
