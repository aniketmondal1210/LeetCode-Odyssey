# Smallest Even Multiple

## Problem
Given a positive integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `2` and `n`.

---

## Input
- A single integer `n`.

---

## Output
- The smallest integer that is a multiple of both `2` and `n`.

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 150`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

n = 5

**Output**  

10

**Explanation**  
The smallest number divisible by both 5 and 2 is 10.  

---

### Example 2
**Input**  

n = 6

**Output**  

6

**Explanation**  
Since 6 is already divisible by 2, the smallest multiple is 6 itself.
