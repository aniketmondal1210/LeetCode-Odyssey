# Alternating Bits

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `n`. Check whether it has **alternating bits**: namely, if two adjacent bits in its binary representation always have different values.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**  

n = 5


**Output:**  

true


**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `5` is `101`, which has alternating bits.

---

## Example 2
**Input:**  

n = 7


**Output:**  

false


**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `7` is `111`, which does not have alternating bits.

---

## Example 3
**Input:**  

n = 11


**Output:**  

false


**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has two adjacent `1`s at the end.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
