# Smallest Number with All Set Bits

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `n`.  
Return the smallest number `x` **greater than or equal to** `n`, such that the **binary representation of `x` contains only set bits** (i.e., all bits are `1`).

---

## Example 1
**Input:**  

n = 5

**Output:**  

7

**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 7 is `111`, which is the smallest number ≥ 5 with all bits set.

---

## Example 2
**Input:**  

n = 10

**Output:**  

15

**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 15 is `1111`.

---

## Example 3
**Input:**  

n = 3

**Output:**  

3

**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of 3 is `11`, which already has all bits set.

## Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
