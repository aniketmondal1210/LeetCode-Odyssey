# Find Unique Element Appearing Once (All Others Appear Thrice)

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears exactly **once**. Find and return that single element.

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Every element in `nums` appears exactly three times except for one.
- Must have **linear runtime** and use **constant extra space**.

## Example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

## Example 2
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
