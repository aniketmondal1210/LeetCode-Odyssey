# Validate Phone Numbers in a Text File

## Problem
You are given a file `file.txt` that contains phone numbers (one per line).  
A valid phone number must match one of the following formats:
- `(xxx) xxx-xxxx`  
- `xxx-xxx-xxxx`  
(where `x` is a digit)

You must print all valid phone numbers using a **one-liner bash script**.
