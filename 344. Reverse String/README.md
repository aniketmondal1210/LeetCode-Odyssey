# Reverse String

## Problem Statement
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with **O(1)** extra memory.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```python
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
```
**Output:**
```python
["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```python
s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
```
**Output:**
```python
["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a printable ASCII character.
