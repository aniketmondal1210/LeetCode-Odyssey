# Power of Three

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a **power of three**. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Input:  
`n = 27`  
Output:  
`true`  
Explanation: 27 = 3^3

---

### Example 2:
Input:  
`n = 0`  
Output:  
`false`  
Explanation: No power of 3 is 0.

---

### Example 3:
Input:  
`n = -1`  
Output:  
`false`  
Explanation: Negative numbers can't be powers of 3.

## Constraints

- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

---

## Follow-up

Can you solve it **without loops or recursion**?
