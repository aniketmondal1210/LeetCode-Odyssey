# Sum of Digits After Base Conversion

## Problem Statement
You are given:  
- An integer `n` (in base 10).  
- A base `k`.  

Your task is to:  
1. Convert `n` from base 10 to base `k`.  
2. Sum all digits of the number in base `k`.  
3. Return the sum (in base 10).

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  

n = 34, k = 6

**Output:**  

9

**Explanation:**  
- 34 in base 6 = `54`  
- Sum = `5 + 4 = 9`

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  

n = 10, k = 10

**Output:**  

1

**Explanation:**  
- 10 in base 10 = `10`  
- Sum = `1 + 0 = 1`
