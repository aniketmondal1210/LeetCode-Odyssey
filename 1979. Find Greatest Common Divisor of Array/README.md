# Greatest Common Divisor of Smallest and Largest Number in Array

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the smallest number and the largest number in `nums`.

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

---

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

nums = [2,5,6,9,10]

**Output**  

2

**Explanation**  
- The smallest number is `2`  
- The largest number is `10`  
- `gcd(2,10) = 2`  

---

### Example 2
**Input**  

nums = [7,5,6,8,3]

**Output**  

1

**Explanation**  
- The smallest number is `3`  
- The largest number is `8`  
- `gcd(3,8) = 1`  

---

### Example 3
**Input**  

nums = [3,3]

**Output**  

3

**Explanation**  
- The smallest number is `3`  
- The largest number is also `3`  
- `gcd(3,3) = 3`
