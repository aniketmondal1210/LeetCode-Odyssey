# Number Complement

## Problem Statement

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation (excluding any leading zeros).

Given an integer `num`, return its complement.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Input:  
`num = 5`  
Output:  
`2`  
Explanation:  
Binary of 5 is `101`, complement is `010` which is 2.

### Example 2:
Input:  
`num = 1`  
Output:  
`0`  
Explanation:  
Binary of 1 is `1`, complement is `0`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= num < 2^31`

## Note

This problem is the same as LeetCode problem [1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/).
