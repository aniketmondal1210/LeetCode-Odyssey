# Find Peak Element

## Problem  
A **peak element** is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.  

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element and return its index.  
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index of **any** peak.  

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.  
In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(log n)** time.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

nums = [1,2,3,1]

**Output**

2

**Explanation**  
Element `3` is a peak at index `2`.

---

### Example 2
**Input**

nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]

**Output**

5

**Explanation**  
Both index `1` (`2`) and index `5` (`6`) are peaks. Returning either is correct.

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
