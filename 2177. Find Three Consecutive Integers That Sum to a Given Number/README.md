# Three Consecutive Integers Sum

## Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, return **three consecutive integers** (as a sorted array) that sum to `num`.  
If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

num = 33

**Output**

[10, 11, 12]

**Explanation**
33 can be expressed as `10 + 11 + 12 = 33`.  
Hence, the answer is `[10, 11, 12]`.

### Example 2
**Input**

num = 4

**Output**

[]

**Explanation**
There is no way to express `4` as the sum of three consecutive integers.

## Constraints
- `0 ≤ num ≤ 10^15`
