# First Element to Occur $k$ Times

## Problem Description

Given an array `arr[]` and an integer `k`, find the first element that occurs at least `k` times in the array.
- If multiple elements satisfy the condition, return the element whose $k$-th occurrence appears earliest in the array.
- If no element occurs at least `k` times, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1
- **Input:** `arr[] = [1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7]`, `k = 2`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** Both `7` and `4` occur twice. However, `4` reaches its second occurrence at index `4`, whereas `7` reaches its second occurrence at index `6`. Since `4` appears earlier, the answer is `4`.

### Example 2
- **Input:** `arr[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4]`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The element `3` is the only element that occurs at least 3 times in the array.

### Example 3
- **Input:** `arr[] = [10, 8, 2]`, `k = 10`
- **Output:** `-1`
- **Explanation:** No element occurs at least 10 times in the array.

## Constraints

- $1 \le \text{arr.size()} \le 10^6$
- $0 \le \text{arr}[i] \le 10^6$
- $1 \le k \le 10^3$
